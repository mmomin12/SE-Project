# SE-Project
This is readme

Our project is called Study Match, which is a web-based system designed to help students empower each other at an academic level. A user must register with a @student.gsu.edu email account. After registering, the user must verify their email, and then log in to populate their profile basic information, the college they fall under at GSU, and what course they are coming to Study Match for. From here, they can post any question, or answer any question on our Discussion Board page. Soon, students will be able to search for a partner from the 'Search Partner' tab, and filter for a "Study Match" to be able to live chat with them to collaborate, share, and help each other on their academic endeavours. This will occr in the 'Chatroom' tab.
